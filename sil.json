Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect solely to the Oracle\nLinux operating system, Oracle will not indemnify you for materials that are not part of the Oracle Linux covered files as\ndefined at http:// www.oracle.com/us/support/library/enterprise-linux-indemnification-069347.pdf.\nIf Oracle believes or it is determined that any of the indemnified material may have violated a third party's intellectual\nproperty rights, Oracle may choose to either modify the indemnified material to be non-infringing (while substantially\npreserving its utility or functionality) or obtain a license to allow for continued use, or if these alternatives are not\ncommercially reasonable, Oracle may end the license for the applicable indemnified material and refund any fees you\nmay have paid to Oracle for it and any unused, prepaid technical support fees you have paid to Oracle for the applicable\nproduct. If Oracle believes or it is determined that the hardware (or portion thereof) may have violated a third party's\nintellectual property rights, Oracle may choose to either replace or modify the hardware (or portion thereof) to be non-\ninfringing (while substantially preserving its utility or functionality) or obtain a right to allow for continued use, or if these\nalternatives are not commercially reasonable, Oracle may remove the applicable hardware (or portion thereof) and refund\nthe net book value. Oracle will not indemnify you or an end user if you or an end user alter indemnified material or of you\ndistribute or the end user uses indemnified material for purposes outside the scope of use identified in the user\ndocumentation or if you distribute or the end user uses a version of the indemnified material which has been superseded,\nif the infringement claim could have been avoided by distributing or using an unaltered current version of the indemnified\nmaterial which was provided to you. Oracle will not indemnify you or an end user to the extent an infringement claim is\nbased upon any indemnified material not provided by Oracle. Oracle will not indemnify you or an end user to the extent\nthat an infringement claim is based upon the combination of any indemnified material with any products or services not\nprovided by Oracle. Oracle will not indemnify you or an end user for infringement caused by you or your end user's\nactions against any third party if the Oracle indemnified material as delivered to you and distributed by you or used by an\nend user in accordance with the terms of this agreement and any distribution addendum would not otherwise infringe any\nthird party intellectual property rights. Oracle will not indemnify you or an end user for any infringement claim that is\nbased on: (1) a patent that you and/or the end user were made aware of prior to the effective date of this agreement\n(pursuant to a claim, demand, or notice); or (2) your actions or the end user's actions prior to the effective date of this\nagreement. If a third party makes a claim against Oracle that any indemnified material, when used in combination with\nany product or services provided by you, infringes their intellectual property rights, and such claim would have been\navoided by the exclusive use of the indemnified material, you will indemnify Oracle.
